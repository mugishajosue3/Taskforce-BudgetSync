# budgetSync - Code of Africa GmbH: Overview

Welcome to budgetSync - Code of Africa GmbH, your go-to solution for seamless expense tracking and financial management, designed with a user-friendly interface to keep you engaged and excited.

## Deployment
This app is deployed using Netlify.
Access the app here: [budgetSync - Code of Africa GmbH](https://budgetSync - Code of Africa GmbH)

## Motivation Behind the Project 
As a university student, keeping track of my expenses is crucial. Many expense-tracking websites and apps either lack functionality or appeal. I aimed to create an expense-tracking app that excels in both. This project also provided an opportunity to learn and implement the Mantine UI library.

## Resources and Technologies Used
Technologies: 
- **ReactJS** 
- **React Router** 
- **React Icons** 
- **TypeScript** 
- **Mantine UI** 
- **HTML Canvas API** 
- **Local Storage** 
- **ViteJS**

Useful Links:
- [React Docs Beta](https://beta.reactjs.org/)
- [React Router Docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [React Icons Website](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)
- [Mantine UI Docs](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/)
- [Canvas API Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)

## Quick Description of the App
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Track your total budget, expenses, and transaction history effortlessly.
- **Reset & Delete Transactions**: Reset budget and expenses, and delete transactions with ease. Deleting a transaction reverses its effect on your budget/expenses.
- **Detailed Transaction Info**: Clicking on a transaction reveals detailed information and the option to delete it.
- **Expense Categorization**: Categorize your expenses with pre-existing categories or create your own.
- **Visual Financial Overview**: Visualize your financial state with an intuitive pie chart.
- **Theme Selection**: Choose between a dark or light theme to suit your preference.
- **Local Data Storage**: All data is securely stored in your browser's local storage.

## Key Learnings
- Advanced my knowledge of types and type safety in TypeScript.
- Enhanced understanding of React hooks, especially the `useContext` hook.
- Gained proficiency with the Mantine UI library and its components.
- Learned to use the HTML Canvas API to draw simple pie charts.
- Worked with external React libraries like React Router and React Icons.
- Leveraged ViteJS to create a React project with TypeScript, as an alternative to create-react-app.
- Became more familiar with inline CSS styling in React components.
- Improved my JavaScript skills, especially array methods like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## Future Steps
- Plan to learn Redux for state management.
- Explore other UI libraries such as Material UI and Chakra UI.
- Make the app mobile responsive using CSS media queries or TailwindCSS.
- Add a backend to budgetSync - Code of Africa GmbH, using a database (most likely MongoDB) to store data instead of local storage.

### Explanation:
- The image is referenced using Markdown syntax: `![Alt text](path-to-image)`.
- Since `homePage.png` is in the `public` folder, the relative path to the image is `public/homePage.png`. 
- The `Alt text` (which is optional) is used to describe the image for accessibility purposes.

Now, when someone views your `README.md` file on GitHub or another platform that supports Markdown rendering, the image will appear as a preview of your app's homepage.
